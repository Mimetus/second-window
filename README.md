# Image Window

This plugin allows you to open an image file in your vault in a new Obsidian window.

Images can be opened in this way by right-clicking on them and selecting "Open in new window", or using the "Open image in new window" command.

# Installation

## From within Obsidian

I recommend installing this plugin via [Obsidian BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

## From GitHub

-   Download the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository
-   Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  
    Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
-   Reload Obsidian
-   If prompted about Safe Mode, you can disable safe mode and enable the plugin.
    Otherwise head to Settings, third-party plugins, make sure safe mode is off and
    enable the plugin from there.
